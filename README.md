Overview
========

This repo is intended to be used as a starter project.  It is based on react-ssr-setup by Manuel Bieh.
It was built as a template for the "atoll" project but has been made available for other developers to
use.  As "atoll" is developed we will, from time-to-time, update this repo as well.

This starter project still contains the original MIT license text and we encourage you to rather use
Manuel Bieh's starter project as he provides updates.  It may actually be a better starter project than
this one!
